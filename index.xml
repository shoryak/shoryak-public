      <description>I recently completed 6 seasons of &amp;ldquo;The 100&amp;rdquo; , a Netflix Series, this series covers a lot of ground, making it an epitome of technological disruption. It is set in a post apocalyptic world , almost a century later an apparent nuclear war resulted in demise of the planet earth , apparently last of humanity resides on a space station , which they call the Ark. The life support at ark is dying so 100 juveniles are sent to the ground to check if it is safe.</description>

      <description>Hi there,    I am currently pursuing bachelors in Electrical engineering and Computer Sciences at IIT Kanpur. Initially, I grew up in a small town in uttarakhand, then moved to BVM a Boarding school in Nainital. After high school, I decided to pursue engineering and somehow ended up here today. I have always been a curious person and enjoyed learning new things. My Interests mostly originate when I come across excellent resources on any subject, a lot on internet thesedays , especially during infamous COVID lockdown.</description>
