      <description>Hi there,    I am currently pursuing bachelors in Electrical engineering and Computer Sciences at IIT Kanpur. Initially, I grew up in a small town in uttarakhand, then moved to BVM a Boarding school in Nainital. After high school, I decided to pursue engineering and somehow ended up here today. I have always been a curious person and enjoyed learning new things. My Interests mostly originate when I come across excellent resources on any subject, a lot on internet thesedays , especially during infamous COVID lockdown.</description>
